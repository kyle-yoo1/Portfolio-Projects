## Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into U.S. public debt trends and patterns using Excel. It focuses on examing the Total Public Debt Outstanding and publicly held debt over several decades, from 1997 to projected figures for 2030.

## Tools
- Excel - Data cleaning & Data Analysis (Pivot tables, conditional formatting, forecast)

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- What was the Yearly Debt Percentage increase for each year compared to the previous year?
  - For the Total Public Debt Outstanding in the years 2016-2019, the average increase was around 5%. In 2020, we can see a large spike that was most likely caused by the pandemic responses in the U.S.

- Which months historically have seen the highest/lowest increases in Total Debt?
  - The highest Debt increases historically occurred during the months of January, February, November, and December.
  - The lowest Debt increases historically occurred during the months of April, May, June, and July.
  - Hypothesis = During the high months, there are holidays in the U.S., such as Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year that people historically spend more money on buying gifts for others. People take out debt for these months to buy these gifts. During the low months, there are no major holidays. So people are spending on less debt during this time.

- What is the projected growth of the publicly held debt in the next few years, by 2023?
  - From 1997 to 2007, we saw an increase of about 1 trillion to publicly held debt. From 2008 to 2019, the debt increased from 6 trillion to 17 trillion. From 2020 to 2024, the debt increased from 21.5 trillion to 24 trillion. From 2025 to 2030, it is projected that the Publicly held debt will increase to 37 trillion.
