# Murder Mystery Project (SQL)
## Project Overview
A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a¬†murder¬†that occurred sometime on Jan.15, 2018¬†and that it took place in SQL City. Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police department‚Äôs database.

## Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
- Primary Keys are unqiue identifiers, ensuring no duplicates. They are represented by gold icons üîë.

- Foreign Keys are arrow üèπ connecting related data across tables, establishing relationships.
