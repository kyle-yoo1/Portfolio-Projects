- Which months historically have seen the highest/lowest increases in Total Debt?
  - The highest Debt increases historically occurred during the months of January, February, November, and December.
  - The lowest Debt increases historically occurred during the months of April, May, June, and July.
  - Hypothesis = During the high months, there are holidays in the U.S., such as Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year that people historically spend more money on buying gifts for others. People take out debt for these months to buy these gifts. During the low months, there are no major holidays. So people are spending on less debt during this time.
